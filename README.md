## General Info
This is the Capstone Project for Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College for my Software and Web Development degree.<br>
It is a database-driven website for a "guild" of players for the popular online video game Final Fantasy 14.<br>
Users are able to log in, check their account for what characters they own in game, as well as check the roster of other guildmates.<br>
There is also an About Us page describing the guild and who they are, as well as an interactive gallery of in-game photos using JavaScript.<br>
Users on the site are able to search for a guildmate using the search bar located in the navigation bar.<br>
Admins to the site are able to delete, edit, and create new characters.

## Link to Website

NOTE:<br>
A bug occurs when following the link above and attempting to view the Roster page and attempting to log in.<br>
Instead of clicking the link above, manually type out the URL in your browser, and it should work just fine.<br>
Will fix in a future update.
