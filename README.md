## General Info
This is the Capstone Project for Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College for my Software and Web Development degree.<br>
It is a database-driven website for a "guild" of players for the popular online video game Final Fantasy 14.<br>
Users are able to log in, check their account for what characters they own in game, as well as check the roster of other guildmates.<br>
There is also an About Us page describing the guild and who they are, as well as an interactive gallery of in-game photos using JavaScript.<br>
Users on the site are able to search for a guildmate using the search bar located in the navigation bar.<br>
Admins to the site are able to delete, edit, and create new characters.
