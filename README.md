WEB289 Project ABTECH
This is the Capstone Project for Asheville-Buncombe Technical Community College for my Software and Web Development degree.
It is a database-driven website for a "guild" of players for the popular online video game Final Fantasy 14.
Users are able to log in, check their account for what characters they own in game, as well as check the roster of other guildmates.
There is also an About Us page describing the guild and who they are, as well as an interactive gallery of in-game photos using JavaScript.
Users on the site are able to search for a guildmate using the search bar located in the navigation bar.
Admins to the site are able to delete, edit, and create new characters.
